# Wrocław Bus Line Shortest Path and TSP Solver
This project consists of two main components:

1. A* Shortest Path Finding Algorithm: This component finds the shortest path between bus stops in Wrocław using the A* algorithm, by 2 different criteria: fastest time or least amount of line change.
2. Tabu Search for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): This component finds the shortest path to visit multiple bus stops using the Tabu Search algorithm.
